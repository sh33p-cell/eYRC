This node subscribes to /cmd_vel (geometry_msgs/Twist: linear.x=vx,
linear.y=vy, angular.z=w) and is supposed to publish the three wheel
speeds it implies on /wheel_commands (std_msgs/Float64MultiArray, ordered
[left, right, back]) for hb_description's bridge_node to apply.

Everything below is scaffolding -- the publisher, the subscriber, the node
setup -- except for body_velocity_to_wheel_speeds(), which is the one part
you need to write. Leave the rest of the file alone.

Usage (once body_velocity_to_wheel_speeds is implemented):
    ros2 launch hb_description task1b.launch.py   # in one terminal
    ros2 run task_1b inverse_kinematics             # in another
    ros2 run task_1b cmd_vel_publisher               # in a third
